Welcome to the EasySocial community support repository.

This repository is managed by the the Open Source community and aims to provide support, bugfixes and compatibility updates to allow EasySocial users to maintain websites that use EasySocial and related StackIdeas products

This repository was created in response to the lack of proper support and updates provided by StackIdeas under thier subscription plans. The general consensus within the community is that subscription costs are not worth the money as they no longer release updates to their products. This leaves users that have made considerable investments into integrating StackIdeas products into their community websites with an uncertain future.

## Project Goals

The aim of this project is to provide ongoing support for StackIdeas products and provide bug fix and compatibility updates to allow community users to maintain websites that currently rely on these products. This project is a community run and supported endeavour. Its sole aim is to help provide those of us who have websites that rely on StackIdeas products to be able to continue to run our websites into the foreseeable future. This need is largely driven by the lack of an alternative product to migrate to.  

The initial aim is to fix compatibility issues with the existing products and address outstanding bug reports. Long term it is hoped that the products may evolve with new features.

## Licensing

StackIdeas products are released under the GPL2 license which allows the published code and derivative works to be released and distributed in accordance with GPL2 terms. This includes all files that form a part of the releases. 

The GPL2 license states that components of GPL licensed code cannot be restricted by a different license and that all such inclusions must be also be released under the GPL2 license. This nullifies the StackIdeas 'Proprietary Use License' from being enforceable. 

The code published within this repository has been done so in line with the terms of the GPL 2 license as linked to below

Contributing to the project is easy. You do not need to be a programmer or tech-savant. Discovering and raising issues, testing, helping out with forum support, documentation and WIKI contributions are all different and valuable ways that you can help the project. As a community we stand together and can provide help to each other. We can all draw on different skills. Sharing those skills within the community to help others is what this project is all about. Hopefully together we stand strong and can carry this project long into the future.
