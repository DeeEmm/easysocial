Welcome to the EasySocial community support repository.

This repository is managed by the the J!User community and aims to provide support, bugfixes and compatibility updates to allow EasySocial users to maintain websites that use EasySocial and related StackIdeas products

This repository was created in response to the lack of proper support and updates provided by StackIdeas for this product. This leaves users that have made considerable investments into integrating this product into their community websites with an uncertain future. Many worried that thier sites will fail to meet requirements for upcoming PHP, SQL and Joomla versions.

## Project Goals

The aim of the J!User project is to provide ongoing support for abandonware products like this one, and provide bug fix and compatibility updates. The goal is to allow users to continue being able to use the products that they have purchased. The J!User project is a community run and supported endeavour. Its sole aim is to help provide those of us who have websites that rely on abandonware products, to be able to continue to run our websites into the foreseeable future. This need in many cases is driven by the lack of alternative products to migrate to. THis is exepcially the case with niche products. 

The initial aim is to fix compatibility issues with the existing products and address outstanding bug reports. Long term it is hoped that the products may evolve with new features.
